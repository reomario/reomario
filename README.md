## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ramy Adel, an aspiring data analyst/scientist transitioning from a background in civil engineering to this overwhelmingly exciting world of data and everything related to it. Since both engineering and data science are rooted in the same principles of problem-solving, I don't feel I'm leaving my comfort zone by moving from one to the other.

### Skills
* Strong analytical and data interpretation skills
* Excellent communication skills
* Ability to manage priorities and cross-functional collaboration 
* Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau
